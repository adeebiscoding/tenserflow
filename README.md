## Food CLassification & Sport Identification:

* models use Functional API
* Fine tuned top layers for better fitting
* food classification uses EfficientNEtB0 with top 5 layers trainable
* Sport identification uses EfficientNetB3 with top 8 layers trainable

## NLP

* 6 models using Naive Bayes, Deep Learning, and pre trained models to analyze emotion in sentences from a kaggle dataset. 
* Plotted accuracy-loss curves to find out overfitting and added Dropout layer for overfit prevention
* Evaluate the best model using a confusion matrix to find out where majority of the errors are.
